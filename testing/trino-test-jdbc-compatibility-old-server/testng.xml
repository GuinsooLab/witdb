<suite name="JdbcCompatibilytOldServer" verbose="1" >
    <!-- We need testng.xml file to express the intent to group tests execution by instances.
          - instanceA.test1()
          - instanceA.test2()
          - instanceB.test1()
          - instanceB.test2()
         Without it the tests are group by test method:
          - instanceA.test1()
          - instanceB.test1()
          - instanceA.test2()
          - instanceB.test2()

         With grouping by test method, test execution is very resource intensive, as each test class instance
         starts up separate Trino server docker container -->
    <test name="all" group-by-instances="true">
        <packages>
            <package name="io.trino"/>
        </packages>
    </test>
