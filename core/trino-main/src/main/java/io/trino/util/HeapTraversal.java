/**
 * If heap nodes are numbered top down, and left to right as follows:
 * <pre>
 *             Node1
 *          /        \
 *       Node2       Node3
 *      /    \       /
 *   Node4 Node5  Node6 ...
 * </pre>
 * We can compute the path from the root to each node by following the binary sequence of 0's and 1s of the index as
 * follows:
 * 1. Starting from the most significant 1 bit, shift to the next most significant bit. If this bit is 0, we need to move to
 * the root's left child, otherwise move to the right child.
 * 2. From the context of this new node, observe the next most significant bit. If this bit is 0, we need to move to this
 * node's left child, otherwise move to the right child.
 * 3. Repeat until all significant bits have been consumed.
 * <pre>
 * Examples:
 * - Node4 => 100 => 1 [ROOT] - 0 [GO LEFT] - 0 [GO LEFT]
 * - Node6 => 110 => 1 [ROOT] - 1 [GO RIGHT] - 0 [GO LEFT]
