/**
 * Service provider interface for an external exchange
 * <p>
 * Used by the engine to exchange data at stage boundaries
 * <p>
 * External exchange is responsible for accepting partitioned data from multiple upstream
 * tasks, grouping that data based on the <code>partitionId</code>
 * (see {@link ExchangeSink#add(int, Slice)}) and allowing the data to be consumed a
 * partition at a time by a set of downstream tasks.
 * <p>
 * To support failure recovery an external exchange implementation is also responsible
 * for data deduplication in an event of a task retry or a speculative execution of a task
 * (when two identical tasks are running at the same time). The deduplication must be done
 * based on the sink identifier (see {@link Exchange#addSink(int)}). The implementation should
 * assume that the data written for the same {@link ExchangeSinkHandle} by multiple sink
 * instances (see {@link Exchange#instantiateSink(ExchangeSinkHandle, int)}) is identical
 * and the data written by an arbitrary instance can be chosen to be delivered while the
 * data written by other instances must be safely discarded
